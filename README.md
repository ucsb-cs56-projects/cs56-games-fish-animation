##Introduction

The goal of this game is for the user, playing as a shark, to eat as many fish as possible. A series of fish will appear on the screen at the start of the game, and the user must click and hold down the mouse on the shark, advancing towards the fish in order to eat them. The game has no time limit, but there are enemies that appear on screen, which if eaten will reduce the point count. If too many negative points are accumulated, the user loses and the game is over. There are three difficulties--easy, medium, and hard--the user can choose from, which include different types and amounts of enemies to make the game harder to beat.

##How to Run
